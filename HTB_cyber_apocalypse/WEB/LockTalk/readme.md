InÂ `config.py`, we can see that the token was generated usingRSA,A so we can't bruteforce the token.

```py
JWT_SECRET_KEY = jwk.JWK.generate(kty='RSA', size=2048)
```
In `requirements.txt`, we can see that it's using an old version of JWT, `python_jwt==3.3.3`, which is vulnerable. According to this: `https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5p8v-58qm-c7fp`

If we tried to generate a token using `/api/v1/get_ticket` it will return `403` because of the configurations in ``haproxy.cfg``

```http-request deny if { path_beg,url_dec -i /api/v1/get_ticket }```

We can bypass this if we add another `/`  to make it like this `//api/v1/get_ticket`
or based on this : `https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2023-45539/`

we can just add a fragment # (encoded) `/api/v1/get_ticket#`

Both will work. After getting the JWT, we can see that we have a role `guest` Let's forge it to `Administrator`
